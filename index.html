<h1> Introduction to Continuous Robotic Learning </h1>
    <img src="https://lifelong-robotic-vision.github.io/about/Relation.png" alt="Human-Robot-Computer" width="520">
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
      More recently, service robots have emerged as a highlight for both academic and industrial field. We start to see applications of robot in our daily life, such as public service robots in locations like airports and hotels. There is even greater potential in applications that are more <strong><I>personal</I></strong>, <strong><I>private</I></strong>, and <strong><I>customized</I></strong>, such as home assistant, elderly care, smart retail etc. To realize such great potential of service robots, one of the long-time technology bottlenecks is <strong><I>the lack of efficient and robust robot learning capability</I></strong>. That is, just the mainstream supervised learning (including Deep Learning) based on large amount of pre-annotated data is not good enough for robotic applications that requires learning continuously in <strong><I>preception</I></strong>, <strong><I>cognition</I></strong>, <strong><I>manipulation</I></strong>, and <strong><I>interaction with users</I></strong>. Indoor environment provides an ideal environment for robot learning especially self-supervised and continual learning, since robots have opportunities interacting with their surroundings more effectively. </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
      The grand challenge aims to provide a platform to evaluate the latest progress of the field. The challenge is designed to have two perspectives: <strong><I>the perception/cognition</I></strong> and <strong><I>the physical tasks</I></strong>. Teams with different background in all related fields are encouraged. This include but not limited to the field of robotics, machine learning, and computer vision. Collaborations are also strongly encouraged. We believe this grand challenge will have significant social, academical, and industrial achievement in future research, and paves a way to large-scale deployment of convenient service robot in the next 5 to 10 years. </p>

<h1>Comptetition Schedule</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The competition schedule is as follows, will be updated later:</p>

<h2> Deadlines (Tentative) </h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong><I>Important notes</I></strong>: Due to current pandemic situation and the consideration that this is the first year of this planned three-year competition, we will make this year's schedule more flexible. Teams can still make registration after the deadline, but earlier registration is encouraged since there might be more issues to deal with for late registration due to scheduling of local testing facilities. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><I>Registration deadline: June 30, 2021 </I></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><I>Acceptance Announcement: July 20, 2021 </I></strong></p>

<h1>Distributed Testing Sites</h1>

Each task force team is allowed to choose a testing site according to their own geographical position and complete on-site testings in about one week. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The potential testing sites are as follows (the confirmed ones are highlighted with light green): </p>

{% include testingSite.html %}

<h2> Call for contribution of local testing facilities </h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Since this competition needs testing at local testing facilities, and we welcome applications to contribute testing facilities from worldwide. 
  Please email yimin.zhang (at) intel.com and xuesong.shi (at) intel.com. </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> There are two types of testing facilities, including full and simplified. Full testing facility may need up to 30 square meters (see the rule book for details). Simplified testing facility only needs space that can complete one of the testing tasks (especially some manipulation task only needs smaller space). </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> All the set up and equipment (robots etc.) should be funded by university lab or company who contributed the testing facility. Also each testing facility needs to recruit volunteers to help on the testing. </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
  To recognize the contribution, the main contact person will be assigned as TPC member (Technical and program committee member) of this Grand challenge.

<h1>Join the Competition</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To join the competition, pls send email to yimin.zhang (at) intel.com and xuesong.shi (at) intel.com with below information:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A 1-2 pages description about your team. It should include the names of team members, their affiliations and contacts, who the team leader is, which track (among the 10 tasks defined in the rulebook) to participate, a brief description of the team's technology, robotic systems (your own robotics platforms), and sensor systems. Video or video link for your demonstrations related to the competition is also welcomed but not required.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For teams who have budget to order standard robot platforms (see details in the rule book), pls indicate this in your email also. We will work with partners to see how to help on this. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Also if you would like to get help in running remote testing (for teams who have no access to nearby local testing facilities), pls let us know. </p>
